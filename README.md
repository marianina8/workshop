# Building Modern CLI Applications in Go

This workshop is designed to teach developers the complete process of designing, building, and testing a modern Command Line Interface (CLI) application. Students will learn how to build a lightweight CLI application from scratch and then explore the benefits of using the Cobra framework to increase development proficiency. They will also gain insights into building applications for different operating systems, using build tags for feature sets, and releasing and distributing applications across Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems via popular package managers such as Homebrew and GoFish.

## To prepare for this workshop, please install the following applications:
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any other IDE.
- [Cobra CLI](https://github.com/spf13/cobra#usage)
- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/)

Also, please make sure to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account for Session 4.

## Examples:
- [Example 1 - Build a CLI using the Go standard library “hello world!”](session1/examples/example1)
- [Example 2 - Create a CLI that takes in a file input, reads in the file, then outputs the content](session1/examples/example2)
