I was trying to find information about the best 
restaurants in the city, so I typed in 'best restaurants' 
as my search term. Unfortunately, the results were all over 
the place and not very helpful. So I refined my SEARCH term 
to 'best restaurants near me', and finally found some great 
options. It's amazing how just changing one word in your 
search Term can make such a big difference in the results 
you get!
